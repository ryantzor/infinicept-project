Hello Nick! <br /><br />
I have finished up the base requirements and now I'm going to style it up a bit and make it more responsive. I am also working on creating a simple in memory database using loki.js. This will allow you to actually save the employee info. <br /><br />

### High-level design: <br />
I used vue.js as my front-end framework. My 'pages' are parent components that contain it's child components like the employee cards etc. I also created components for the navbar and footer that persist across the application.


## Usage:
### client side
http://localhost:8080
``` bash
with npm:
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

``` bash
with yarn:
$ npm install
$ yarn serve
```

### server side
``` bash
TODO
```
